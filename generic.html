TGL International is renowned as one of the world's leading retailers imaging supplies for businesses of all sizes. We specialize in servicing pharmacies, law firms, schools, banks, manufacturers, automobile dealerships, non-profit organizations, hospitals, government offices, staffing agencies, hotels, and resorts.</p>
					<p>TGL International is a Green Company, which means we care about the environment and encourage our clients to do likewise. As such, we offer to send shipping labels and materials for our clients to send their used toner cartridges back to us so they may be recycled, thereby reducing the amount of wasted space in American landfills. We also offer rock-bottom prices on compatible ink cartridges that meet or exceed all of the original manufacturer's specifications, thereby minimizing resources that add to greenhouse gases and the production of harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>
					<p>It is our dedication to the needs and wants of businesses in the 21st century that enables us to stay on the cutting edge of new technology while consistently maintaining the same high level of customer service for which we've become known. We're exceedingly proud to carry the latest technology and best products from the top brands. We carry all of the leading brands. Dell, Brother, Canon, Epson, Lexmark, Panasonic, Sharp, Hewlitt-Packard, Toshiba, and many, many more.</p>
